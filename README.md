# Console
This project was tasked create a console for setting and monitoring the temperature regime. 

Project technical requirements: 
- Languages: English or French; 
- Temperature: Celsius or Kelvin;

- Digital parameter setting panel; 
- Operating panel: indication of the current status and buttons 
  for adjusting the temperature, turning on / off the console.

I developed a program in the Arduino IDE environment, which, based 
on the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller, complete with the SPI TFT_ILI9341 display, 
implements all the technical requirements of the project.
